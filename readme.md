# Vinland Saga Tactics

Hello there! <br />
If you have found yourself stumbling across this repository then; welcome!

## Disclaimer
This is a currently unfinished fan made game for the Manga series Vinland Saga, written and drawn by Makoto Yukimura. This is not for profit and instead a fan's protrayal of some of the in story events in a Video Game setting.

## What is Vinland Saga Tactics?
It is inspired by the Fire Emblem GBA games, Divinity Original Sin 2, Undertale and Final Fantasy Tactics - the later of which is one I have not played but as far as I understand the aesthetic similarities are there.
